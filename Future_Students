Some things for future students:
    -use ssh (yourusername)@nova.its.iastate.edu to connect to the server.
    -Use sftp (yourusername)@nova.its.iastate.edu to connect to the server and move items between the server and computer.
        -Use "get -r file/directory" to move files from the server to the computer.
        -Use "put -r file/directory" to move files from the computer to the server.
    -The inputs.zip in energy_reader is not complete, and it will need to be finished.
    -To submit a job in Nova, use sbatch "job name".
    -Use squeue -u "username" to see your jobs running and their IDs.
    -Use scancel "job id" to cancel jobs. 
    -Ask questions if you need to, and good luck. 

The purpose of this repository is to extract the energy and time from the output files in the "inputs" directory, which were generated by NWChem. It also takes xyz files and converts them into usable NWChem input files.

-Every large directory has been compressed into a zip file.

-To get to the location in Nova. The directory is cd /work/simcodes/dwoodard/. 

There will be two different directories: 
-comparing
 This is running the molecules found in Devarsh_Repo/Clustering_Algorithm_on_Molecular_Graphs/Fragments_Generated in GitHub. It needs to be compared to the energies found in Devarsh_Pepo. 
-dipeptide
 This is running all the dipeptides found in the xyz directory.
 If a job in dipeptide has finished running, but there are still dipeptides to be run. Then just submit the job again. You do not need to move the finished files because it will do it automatically.
